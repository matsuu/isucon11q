  includes contemporary changes for Russia (Volgograd).


2.45    2020-12-21

- Fixed handling of Etc/GMT[+-]XX zones. Confusingly, the POSIX interpretation
  is that Etc/GMT+1 is 1 hour _behind_ UTC, and Etc/GMT-1 is 1 hour
  ahead. This is the opposite of what this module started doing in the 2.38
  release when it added support for these zones. Reportd by Matthew Horsfall
  (#47). Changes are based on his PR #48.


2.44    2020-11-06

  generated data files.


2.40    2020-10-07

- This release is based on version 2020b of the Olson database. This release
  includes contemporary changes for Morocco, Casey Station, and the
  Yukon. This release also removes the very long-deprecated "US/Pacific-New"
  zone name.

  includes contemporary changes for Brazil and Palestine.


2.35    2019-04-21

  objects. On Solaris we end up with "infinity" and "-infinity" as opposed to

  $ENV{TZ} if you're writing tests for code that tries to use the local time
  zone.

- This release is based on version 2018f of the Olson database. This release
  includes contemporary changes for Russia (Volgograd), Fiji, and Chile.

2.17    2018-01-23

  reverts the changes for Ireland in the previous versions as these caused
  breakages in some systems that consumed the IANA time zone data.


2.16    2018-01-19

- This release is based on version 2018b of the Olson database. This release
  includes contemporary changes for São Tomé and Príncipe, Brazil, and

- Make the local zone lookup code handle the case where /usr/share/zoneinfo is
  a symlink, as it apparently is on recent versions of macOS (10.13). Fixed by
  Tom Wyant. GH #22 and #23.


2.14    2017-10-28

- This release is based on version 2017c of the Olson database. This release
  includes contemporary changes for Fiji, Namibia, Northern Cyprus, Sudan,
  Tonga, and Turks & Caicos.


2.13    2017-06-01

  kidding. Thanks to Grinnz on #metacpan for giving me the solution.

  prereqs on Windows system automatically when building the release.


2.03    2016-09-17

- Replaced Params::Validate with Params::ValidationCompiler.


2.01    2016-07-17

- This release is based on version 2016f of the Olson database. This release
  includes contemporary changes for Egypt and Russia. The changes for Egypt
  supersede the ones in 2016e.


2.00    2016-06-07

- The fix in 1.99 broke the parsing of the etcetera zones, which are specified
  as 1 or 2 digit offsets in hours, unlike all other zones which are written
  as "1:00" or "-2:00".


1.99    2016-06-07

- When parsing the POSIX zones in the etcetera file, don't special case the
  ETC[+-]NN zones. These are weirdly named, as ETC+8 is 8 hours _behind_ UTC,
  and -6 is 6 hours _ahead_. Previously, we were swapping these so the name
  matched the sane usage, but this is confusing for anyone who is explicitly
  trying to use the POSIX names, expecting the bizarre (but POSIXly correct)
  interpretation. Patch by Bron Gondwana. GitHub PR #7.


1.98    2016-04-18

- This release is based on version 2016d of the Olson database. This release

  includes contemporary changes for Moldova, North Korea, and Uruguay.


1.92    2015-06-22

- This distro now depends on DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32 when it is being
  installed on a Windows OS. This should lead to a better experience for
  Windows users. Requested by Matthew Horsfall and Karen Etheridge. RT
  #103275.


1.91    2015-06-13

- This release is based on version 2015e of the Olson database. This release
  includes contemporary changes for Morocco and Cayman Islands.


1.90    2015-05-14

- Made the compilation test shipped in the last release an author-only test,
  as many of the modules in this distribution try to load DateTime, but
  DateTime depends on this distribution. This caused attempts to install
  DateTime on a fresh perl install to fail. Reported by Noel Maddy. RT
  #104448.


1.89    2015-05-14

  DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32. This gets rid of circular dependencies
  between those distros and this one. RT #101588, 101589 and 68231.


1.83    2014-12-24

- The last release did not include any of the generated zone files. Oops.

  real code or zone changes.

- Removed tests for Win32 code.


1.80    2014-11-16

- This distro no longer ships the DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32
  module. Instead, it depends on that module when you install
  DateTime::TimeZone on a Windows system machine.

- Tweaked the warning when loading a zone class from disk that was generated
  using a different Olson version than the current DateTime::TimeZone
  module. Previously, it said the loaded version was older, but all we know is
  that it's different. Reported by Karen Etheridge. RT #66097.


1.79    2014-11-11

- This release is based on version 2014j of the Olson database. This release
  only contemporary changes for Turks & Caicos.


1.78    2014-11-05

- Fix warnings from Perl 5.8.8 and before. Apparently it doesn't like when
  $SIG{__DIE__} is set to undef. Patch by Peter Rabbitson. GitHub PR #88.


1.77    2014-11-04

- Updated the mapping of Windows -> IANA time zones. Patch by David
  Pinkowitz. RT #10025.

- Replaced Class::Load with Module::Runtime, and replaced eval with Try::Tiny.


1.76    2014-10-26

- When searching for the local timezone we now look at /etc/timezone before
  /etc/localtime. The former is a much quicker check if it exists. Patch by
  Karen Etheridge. PR #3.

- The tools/parse_olson script now supports parsing the etcetera and systemv
  files. This is *not* enabled by default as it would generate zones that
  conflict with existing links for Etc/UTC and others. Patch by Alfie John. PR
  #1.


1.75    2014-09-30

- This release is based on version 2014h of the Olson database. This release

- Don't run tests for Unix on non-Unix boxes.


1.68    2014-05-13

- The last release was missing some test changes I made on another
  machine. Doh.


1.67    2014-05-13

- I accidentally skipped 1.66, don't read anything into the 0.02 version bump
  here.

- This release is based on version 2014c of the IANA database (I skipped 2014b

  depending on the method used to find the local time zone name. The resulting
  variable would often be tainted. We now untaint all names before attempting
  to load them. Reported by Stevie-O. RT #92631.


1.63    2013-10-28

- This release is based on version 2013h of the Olson database. This release

  includes contemporary changes for Chile as well as several new zones -
  Asia/Khandyga, Asia/Ust-Nera, and Europe/Busingen. It also includes a number
  of historical changes.


1.56    2012-11-30

- The previous release was missing some files. That's what I get for running
  "git clean -dxf". Reported by Andreas Koenig. RT #81593.


1.55    2012-11-30

1.50    2012-09-16

- In scalar context, DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_category returned an
  arrayref containing an arrayref (rather than _just_ an arrayref). Reported
  by Ed Shrock. RT #76791.

- The DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_category claimed that it returned names
  based on the population of the zone. I don't think this was ever true, but
  this data is definitely not part of the current Olson database. Reported by
  Ed Shrock. RT #76792.

  However, the DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_country method does preserve the
  order specified in the Olson database, which is sort of based on population
  and geography. This method is probably the best choice for presenting a list
  of names to end user.


1.49    2012-09-13

  includes contemporary changes for Brazil, Moldova, and Ukraine.

1.15    2010-03-29

- This release is based on version 2010g of the Olson database. This release
  includes changes for Bangladesh, Palestine, and Russia.


1.14    2010-03-22

  has changes for Bangladesh, Fiji, Samoa, and Chile.


1.11    2010-03-01

- This release is based on version 2010c of the Olson database. This release
  has changes for Paraguay.

- Added a list of zones by country, and a list of zone links (aliases) to the
  docs for DateTime::TimeZone::Catalog.


1.10    2010-01-25

- This release is based on version 2010b of the Olson database. This release
  has changes for Mexico.


1.09    2010-01-18

- This release is based on version 2010a of the Olson database. This release
  has changes for Bangladesh.


1.08    2009-12-28

- This release is based on version 2009u of the Olson database. This release
  has changes for Bangladesh.


1.07    2009-12-24

- Fixed for local time zone determination on Win32. Our tests broke after the
  December 2009 Cumulative Time Zone Update from Microsoft. Patch by David
  Pinkowitz. RT #52978.


1.06    2009-12-21

- This release is based on version 2009t of the Olson database. This release
  has no user-visible changes, but I like to follow along anyway.


1.05    2009-11-16

- This release is based on version 2009s of the Olson database. It includes
  changes for Antarctica and Fiji.


1.04    2009-11-09

- This release is based on version 2009r of the Olson database. It includes
  changes for Antarctica.


1.03    2009-11-02

- This release is based on version 2009q of the Olson database. It includes
  historical changes for Hong Kong, updates for Syria, and a new zone,
  Asia/Novokuznetsk.


1.02    Not Released  (Oops)

- This release is based on version 2009p of the Olson database. The only
  changes in this release are for Argentina. This release should produce the
  same results as 1.01, but I did a new release just to keep up to date with
  the Olson versions.


1.01    2009-10-19

- This release is based on version 2009o of the Olson database. This release
  has changes for Pakistan and Bangladesh. In addition, I have also applied
  the Argentina patch again, as this has not been incorporated into the
  official Olson data yet.

- The t/04local.t test file will be skipped on HPUX, which is a very weird
  system. Suggested by Olivier Mengué. Fixes RT #50640.

- When installing this module on HPUX, it now adds DateTime::TimeZone::HPUX to
  its prereqs so you can determine the local time zone. Suggested by Olivier
  Mengué.


1.00    2009-10-17

- This release adds a patch from Debian (http://bugs.debian.org/551195) for
  Argentina. Argentina's idiotic government decided to change their DST rules
  with two days notice. Pointer to patch from Gregor Herrman. Fixes RT #50590.


0.99    2009-09-28

- This release is based on version 2009n of the Olson database. This
  release has changes for Pakistan.


0.98    2009-09-11

- Fixes for Win32 time zones. Added handling for new Windows time zones,
  thanks to Jim Brunette. This should fix test failures on some Win32 systems.


0.97    2009-09-08

- This release is based on version 2009m of the Olson database. This
  release has changes for Samoa and Palestine.


0.96    2009-08-18

- A $SIG{__DIE__} related test in 04local.t behaved differently on different
  platforms. The test has been narrowed so that it should work the same on all
  platforms. Reported by Jens Rehsack.


0.95    2009-08-18

- Attempting to load an invalid Olson-style name like "Bad/Name" did throw an
  error since 0.92. Reported by Florian Ragwitz.

- Localized $SIG{__DIE__} for every eval.


0.94    2009-08-17

- This release is based on version 2009l of the Olson database. This
  release has changes for Egypt.

- Localize $SIG{__DIE__} in DateTime::TimeZone::Local, so errors in evals done
  by that module are not seen by existing __DIE__ handlers. Based on a patch
  from Jim. RT #48567.


0.93    2009-07-20

- This release is based on version 2009k of the Olson database. This
  release has changes for Bangladesh and Mauritius.


0.92    2009-06-17

- This release is based on version 2009j of the Olson database. This
  release has changes for Bangladesh.

  I skipped the 2009i release because I was confused about how to handle the
  weird rules for Bangladesh (which has a change _to_ DST without any future
  change _from_ DST, but that's governments for you).

- Made sure to local-ize $@ before any eval, to prevent errors
  accidentally propagating out to your code.


0.91    2009-05-26

- This release is based on version 2009h of the Olson database. This
  release has no user-visible changes, but I like to follow along
  anyway.


0.90    2009-04-27

- This release is based on version 2009g of the Olson database. This
  release has changes for Egypt.


0.89    2009-04-13

- This release is based on version 2009f of the Olson database. This
  release has changes for Pakistan.


0.88    2009-04-06

- This release is based on version 2009e of the Olson database. This
  release has changes for Jordan and Palestine.


0.87    2009-04-05

- The DateTime::TimeZone::Local module will now try to load a subclass
  of the form DateTime::TimeZone::Local::$^O before falling back to
  the Unix subclass. This allows you to provide a new subclass on
  systems where the existing subclasses (Unix, Win32, and VMS) don't
  get the right answer. Based on a patch from Olivier Mengué.


0.86    2009-03-23

- This release is based on version 2009d of the Olson database. This
  release has changes for Morocco, Tunisia, Syria, and Argentina.


0.85    2009-03-16

- This release is based on version 2009c of the Olson database. The
  only changes in this release are for Cuba.

- Fixes for Win32 with Microsoft's December time zone update. This
  updated added a zone for Mauritius that wasn't accounted for in the
  DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32 module. Reported by David
  Pinkowitz. RT #43535.

- Added a hack to fix some brokenness with Module::Build::Compat that
  causes the compatibility Makefile.PL to fail on really old
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker versions (6.17 and older). RT #43605.


0.84    2009-01-21

- This release is based on version 2009a of the Olson
  database. Changes include spelling "Katmandu" as "Kathmandu" (with a
  link for the old spelling), fixes for historical rules in
  Switzerland, and changes to America/Resolute and Cuba for the past
  few years (but not present).

- If DateTime::TimeZone::Local could not load its OS-specific subclass
  because of a missing dependency, it would silently fall back on
  loading the Unix subclass, rather than throwing an error. RT #41305.

- Fixed a bug where the short names for some time zones were
  wrong. This mostly (exclusively?) manifested in time zone rules for
  the first half of the 20th century or so.


0.8301  2008-11-07

- Test fixes only. The 19local-win32 tried to skip tests when they're
  run without write access to the registry, but this was done in a
  very broken way.


0.83    2008-10-27

- This release is based on version 2008i of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for Argentina.

- Updated the docs on how the local time zone is determined for
  various platforms.


0.82    2008-10-13

- This release is based on version 2008h of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for Mauritius and Syria.


0.81    2008-10-06

- This release is based on version 2008g of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for Brazil.


0.80    2008-09-15

- This release is based on version 2008f of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for Mauritius, Morocco, Pakistan,
  Argentina, and Brazil.


0.7904  2008-08-30

- Added three more Windows time zone names to the Windows -> Olson
  mapping. This should fix test failures on up-to-date Windows
  boxes. Patch by David Pinkowitz. RT #38735.


0.7903  2008-08-22

- The DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_country() method was broken when
  called as a method. Reported by Lars Eggert. RT #38665.


0.7902  2008-08-18

- Fixed a lingering reference to DT::TimeZoneCatalog, which broke
  t/15catalog.t on fresh installs.


0.7901  2008-08-18

- This distro now provides the CET, EET, MET, and WET zones. These are
  provided by the Olson database for backwards compatibility. It's
  probably a bad idea to use them, but it's best if this package
  matches what a Unix system provides.

- Moved the catalog to DateTime::TimeZone::Catalog, which now has some
  POD that lists all the available zones.


0.79    2008-07-29

- This release is based on version 2008e of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for Mauritius and Central Europe
  (historical changes only).

- Fixes for the local TZ tests on Win32. Thanks to David Pinkowitz for
  pointing out my mistake.


0.78    2008-07-12

- This release is based on version 2008d of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for Mauritius and Brazil (which
  now has a new America/Santarem zone).


0.7701  2008-06-03

- Many fixes and improvements to the tests for local time zone
  handling on Windows. Based on a patch from David Pinkowitz.

* There are no code changes in this release besides these test
  changes.


0.77     2008-05-27

- This release is based on version 2008c of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for Morocco, Mongolia, and
  Pakistan.

- More Windows changes from David Pinkowitz. Determining the local
  time zone on a Win32 system should now work regardless of the
  system's locale. Previously it only worked for English language
  systems. RT #36201.


0.76     2008-05-18

* Dropped support for Perl 5.005.

- Made the Win32 local time zone bits work on Vista and Server
  2008. Patch by David Pinkowitz. RT #35733.


0.75     2008-04-25

- A stray STORABLE_attach method in DT::TZ::Floating caused freezing
  and thawing a floating timezone with Storable to fail
  badly. Reported by Kostas Chatzikokolakis.

- Changed the local time zone detection on Win32 to only require read
  access to the registry. Patch by David Pinkowitz. RT #35273.


0.74     2008-03-24

- This release is based on version 2008b of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for San Luis in Argentina, Cuba,
  Iraq, and Syria.


0.73     2008-03-08

- The DT::TZ::Local::VMS module declared its package as
  DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32, which clearly is not
  right. Patched by Peter Prymmer.

- This release is based on version 2008a of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for Argentina and Chile,


0.72     2007-12-31

- This release is based on version 2007j of the Olson database. The
  major changes in this release are for Argentina.


0.71     2007-12-28

- Fixes a major bug in the generation of time zone data. This bug
  affected any time zone that has more than one rule (most of them)
  and currently has no DST changes (many of them). An example would be
  America/Caracas. The symptom would either be mistakes about the
  current time zone or bogus exceptions when trying to create a local
  date. Reported by Éric Cholet.


0.70     2007-12-03

- This release is based on version 2007j of the Olson database. There
  is one major change in this release, for the new Venezuelan time
  zone.


0.6904   2007-11-09

- Updated the Windows -> Olson conversion table, though it's still
  English-only. Added some more Win32 tests to hopefully help diagnose
  a test failure report from a Win32 tester.


0.6903   2007-11-08

- The Win32::TieRegistry prereq was requiring version 1.0, which
  doesn't exist. I meant to require just any version. Reported by
  CJM. RT #30580.

- No code changes in this release.


0.6902   2007-11-05

- Fixed many sloppy uses of eval blocks which would leave $@ set after
  calling various DT::TZ methods/functions. This could cause unrelated
  error checking to find $@ set to something and log an error or
  die. Reported by Kat.


0.6901   2007-11-02

- Add Win32::TieRegistry to our prereqs if we're on Win32. Reported by
  Ruud H.G. van Tol.


0.69     2007-11-01

- This release is based on version 2007i of the Olson database, which
  includes changes to Cuba and Syria.


0.68     2007-10-01

- This release is based on version 2007h of the Olson database, which
  includes changes to Egypt, Iran, Palestine, Brazil, and Venezuela.


0.67     2007-08-20

- This release is based on version 2007g of the Olson database, which
  includes changes to Egypt, Antarctica, Australia, and Indiana (Perry
  County).


0.6603   2007-07-07

- The DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_country() method returned the wrong
  thing in scalar context. Instead of a simple array reference, it
  returned a reference to an array reference. Reported by John
  O'Rourke. RT #27843.


0.6602   2007-05-29

- There was a bug in the 04local.t tests that did not manifest itself
  on my dev machine, but would've been seen on any machine with an
  /etc/default/init file. Reported by Jonathan Leffler.


0.6601   2007-05-08

- 0.66 screwed up the test count in 04local.t if certain tests were
  skipped. Reported by David Precious.


0.66     2007-05-07

- This release is based on version 2007f of the Olson database, which
  includes changes to Haiti, Turks and Caicos Islands, and New
  Zealand.

- If /etc/localtime is a symlink, but trying to follow that link does
  not find a zone name, fall back to trying to find a matching file in
  /usr/share/zoneinfo. RT #26438.

- Require Cwd 3.0+, since Cwd;:abs_path() in older versions does not
  following a chain of symlinks.


0.6501   2007-04-22

- The test for the new symlink handling could fail on some systems
  (notably OSX). Reported by Randal Schwartz.


0.65     2007-04-21

- Handle cases where /etc/localtime is a symlink pointing to another
  symlink (and so forth) by using Cwd::abs_path() instead of
  readlink(). Fixes RT #26438.

- When creating an Olson time zone object, DT::TZ will now check to
  see if the object being loaded is from an older version of the Olson
  catalog than the current version of DT::TZ and issue warning if this
  is the case. This is useful because obsolete module files may exist
  when a zone name is replaced by a link, or just retired entirely.


0.64     2007-04-02

- This release is based on version 2007e of the Olson database
  (changes in the Syria and Honduras time zones).


0.63     2007-03-20

- This release is based on version 2007d of the Olson database.

- Fix determination of local time zone on systems where /etc/localtime
  is a symlink. This broke in 0.61. Reported by Bradley C Bailey. RT
  #25348.


0.62     2007-02-26

- This release is based on version 2007c of the Olson database.


0.6101   2007-02-18

- Fixes a major bug in 0.61. Passing "local" as a time zone new to
  DateTime::TimeZone->new() caused a fatal error.


0.61     2007-02-18

- Lots of internal changes in the code used to determine a system's
  local time zone.

- As a result, we now have a much better method for doing this on
  Windows systems, by looking at the registry. See
  DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32 for details.


0.60     2007-02-13

- This release is based on version 2007b of the Olson database.


0.59     2007-01-18

- When trying to find the local timezone for a machine based on
  /etc/localtime, ignore /usr/share/zoneinfo/posixrules. This fixes a
  bug seen on FreeBSD 6.2. Reported by . RT #24026.

- For infinity, use 100 ** 1000 instead of 100 ** 100 ** 100. This may
  fix the problems with infinity on some platforms (or may
  not). Suggested by Bjorn Tackmann.


0.58     2007-01-08

- This release is based on version 2007a of the Olson database.


0.57     2006-11-27

- This release is based on version 2006p of the Olson database.


0.56     2006-11-16

- Really fix the sorting of names_in_country(). Patch by Tatsuhiko
  Miyagawa.

- Allow names like "JST-9" and "GMT+0" in $ENV{TZ} when trying to find
  the local time zone. Reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.


0.55     2006-11-06

- This release is based on version 2006o of the Olson database.


0.54     2006-10-25

- Got rid of the STORABLE_attach methods. This was causing bugs when
  trying to freeze/thaw a DateTime.pm object, and I realized that
  because of how the DT::TimeZone internals work, there's not much
  gained by using STORABLE_attach instead of STORABLE_freeze. Even
  with STORABLE_freeze, the core data structures for a timezone are
  still shared.


0.53     2006-10-24

- Freezing and thawing a DT::TimeZone::OffsetOnly object was broken in
  0.52 (and probably earlier versions as well). Reported by Tatsuhiko
  Miyagawa.

- Freezing and thawing a DT::TimeZone::Floating object was also broken.


0.52     2006-10-22

- The names_in_country() method no longer sorts the zone
  names. Instead, it returns them in order from most- to
  least-populated.

- Added a STORABLE_attach method for integration with newer versions
  of Storable which provide better support for singletons.

- Made offset_as_seconds() and offset_as_string() work as class
  methods, since the docs say they should. Reported by Tatsuhiko
  Miyagawa.


0.51     2006-10-13

- Added two new catalog-related functions, countries() and
  names_in_country(). Using these functions allows you to map ISO3066
  country codes to the time zones used in that country. Based on code
  by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.


0.50     2006-10-10

- This release is based on version 2006n of the Olson database.


0.49     2006-10-02

- This release is based on version 2006m of the Olson database.


0.48     2006-09-18

- This release is based on version 2006l of the Olson database.

- Fix finding of local time zone when there is a $SIG{__DIE__} handler
  in effect. The handler broke the internal use of exceptions in one
  of DateTime::TimeZone::Local's methods. Reported by JD Hedden. RT
  #20982.


0.47     2006-08-22

- This release is based on version 2006j of the Olson database.

- Added a link to Asia/Tokyo for the "JST-9" timezone. According to
  Kenichi Ishigaki this is a TZ env var setting commonly used in
  Japan.

- Some links in the Olson data pointed to other links, or pointed to
  non-existent zone names. These have been fixed so that all links
  resolve to valid zones, and this is now part of the test suite.


0.46     2006-05-08

- This release is based on version 2006g of the Olson database.


0.45     2006-05-01

- This release is based on version 2006f of the Olson database.


0.44     2006-04-17

- This release is based on version 2006d of the Olson database.


0.43     2006-04-13

- This release is based on version 2006c of the Olson database.

- Added a link for AKST9AKDT (to America/Anchorage).


0.42     2006-02-20

- This release is based on version 2006b of the Olson database.


0.41     2006-01-31

- This release is based on version 2006a of the Olson database.


0.40     2005-12-27

- This release is based on version 2005r of the Olson database.  This
  includes the latest Canadian changes to match the recent US changes.
  Also note that as of this version several zones which used to be
  links, including "EST", "MST", and "CST6DST", are now separate
  zones.


0.39     2005-06-05

- This release is based on version 2005o of the Olson database.


0.3801   2005-11-24  the "not turkey day" release

- The last release included some generated modules for old zones (like
  Europe/Belfast) which are now links to existing zones.  These
  modules referenced the non-existent DateTime::TimeZone::Singleton
  module.  Reported by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.


0.38     2005-11-21

- Trying to create a DateTime object during DST exactly 11 years in
  the future (really, 1 year after the end of the pre-generated TZ
  change data that ships in the package) cause an error.  Reported by
  Daniel B Boorstein.

- This release is based on version 2005n of the Olson database.

- Added a new method, has_dst_changes(), which indicates whether a
  given zone has any DST changes.


0.37     2005-08-22

- Make sure that provided time zone names are valid, because
  DateTime::TimeZone uses them in an eval.  If you were passing
  user-provided data directly to DateTime::TimeZone->new, someone
  could give a string like "America/Chicago; system 'rm -rf /';",
  which would be bad.  Reported by Matthew Reilly.

- Made it possible to call catalog-related functions as methods.

- This release is based on version 2005l of the Olson database.  This
  include some major changes coming up in the US as a whole in 2007,
  along with other changes for just Indiana.


0.36     2005-04-21

- This release is based on version 2005i of the Olson database.


0.35     2005-03-15  the "I hate this dope" release

- This release is based on version 2005g of the Olson database.

- STORABLE_thaw() now returns $self in preparation for proposed
  changes to Storable.


0.34     2005-03-11

- Some time zone short names were incorrectly being given as something
  like "GMT/BST", when it should have been alternating between GMT and
  BST based on the daylight saving time.  Reported by Tom Yandell.

- This release is based on version 2005f of the Olson database.


0.33     2005-02-26

- This release is based on version 2005e of the Olson database.

- When trying to determine the local time zone, if /etc/localtime is a
  file, make sure that matching file in /usr/share/zoneinfo is not a
  symlink.


0.32     2004-01-05

- Fix for bug revealed by DateTime 0.23, which could cause an
  "undefined value in eq" warning when creating objects for dates in
  the far future that were during DST.

- This release is based on version 2005a of the Olson database.


0.31     2004-12-09

- This release is based on version 2004g of the Olson database.


0.30     2004-10-13

- This release is based on version 2004e of the Olson database.


0.29     2004-09-22

- This release is based on version 2004d of the Olson database.


0.28     2004-07-24

- This release is based on version 2004b of the Olson database.  Note
  that some Argentinian time zones have moved from America to
  America/Argentina, though there are aliases for the old names.


0.27     2004-05-27

- This release is based on version 2004a of the Olson database.

- /etc/timezone and /etc/TIMEZONE are not the same thing.  Code for
  getting the local time zone name from the latter was supplied by
  Daniel Boorstein.

- Added support for getting the local time zone from
  /etc/default/init.  Suggested by Daniel Boorstein.


0.2601   2004-03-16

- Fix test failure which could happen if tests were run before
  DateTime.pm is installed.  Reported by Slaven Rezic.


0.26     2004-03-09

- Added DateTime::TimeZone->is_valid_name class method.

- Added Storable freeze & thaw hooks.  This should fix RT ticket
  #5542, reported by Dan Rowles (I hope).


0.2507   2004-02-14  the "nothing says love like timezones" release

- Fix a test failure in t/04-local.t on systems where /etc/localtime
  is a copy of a zoneinfo file, not a symlink.  This was a bug in the
  testing code.  Reported by Warren Dodge and a few others.

- If /etc/localtime was a copy of a zoneinfo file, then the current
  working directory could be changed while trying to determine the
  local time zone, because we use File::Find to find a matching
  zoneinfo file.  Reported by someone ... (I can't find the message
  reporting this).

- Update the Makefile.PL to work with Module::Build 0.23.


0.2506   2003-12-15

- On systems where /etc/localtime is a copy of a zone info file (like
  FreeBSD), we now look for a matching file in /usr/share/zoneinfo in
  order to determine the local time zone.  Based on a patch from
  Slaven Rezic.

- This release is based on the 2003e Olson database.


0.2505   2003-10-27

- The change in 0.2504 to accommodate SuSE's /etc/sysconfig/clock file
  broke this feature on RedHat.  Sigh.  Reported by John Siracusa.


0.2504   2003-10-25

- If a timezone module cannot be loaded, give a more useful error
  message if the failure is due to a syntax error in the module, as
  opposed to the specified time zone not existing.  Based on a patch
  from Alexey Mahotkin.

- Require Pod::Man 1.14+, so that head3/head4 markup doesn't cause
  installation to die.

- SuSE puts TIMEZONE="Foo/Bar" in the /etc/sysconfig/clock file, but
  DT::TZ::Local just looked for ZONE="...".  Reported by Pete.


0.2503   2003-10-06

- Made the offset string -> number conversion slightly less strict, so
  that 1:00:00 is accepted, as opposed to required 01:00:00.  Without
  colons, it still must be four or six digits, however.

- This release is based on the 2003d Olson database, which contains
  updates for various zones.

- Fixed a bug in DateTime::TimeZone::OlsonDB for zones where an
  observance change occurred at UTC year X, and a new rule started at
  local year X + 1, but the offset meant that these were actually the
  same year.  No zones in the previous release were affected, and this
  bug was only uncovered by the new Olson data.

- Handle rule times of 24:00 in the Olson data.  Again, this was not
  present in previous versions of the Olson data.


0.2502   2003-09-09

- Lots of fixes and improvements in how offsets are converted from
  strings to numbers.  Also, a DT::TZ::OffsetOnly object now
  normalizes its offset so that two offsets created from different
  strings, but representing the same offset, now return the same value
  from the name() method.  Patched by Joshua Hoblitt.

- More env vars and files are looked at when trying to determine what
  the local time zone is.  Thanks to Date::Manip for this.

- Added SIGNATURE file to distribution.


0.2501   2003-08-10

- Fixed a test that failed because of a change in the DateTime.pm
  from_object() API.


0.25     2003-07-20

- Removed a test that only passed with DateTime CVS HEAD installed.


0.24     2003-07-20

- Fixed bugs in generated data for many time zones.  Upgrading is
  highly recommended!

- This version is _much_ better tested than any previous version.  The
  script tools/tests_from_zdump can be used to generate fairly
  comprehensive tests for almost every time zone.  The generated tests
  are not shipped with the distribution because they are too huge, and
  take too long to run (400,000+ tests in about 25 minutes).


0.23     2003-07-03

- $_ was being overwritten if you specified a time zone of "local".
  This could cause problems in for loops with implicit iterators if
  you were to create a DateTime object with a "local" time zone inside
  your own loops.  Fixed by Iain Truskett.


0.22     2003-06-28

- The is_olson method was returning true for all objects.  Reported by
  Flavio Glock.


0.21     2003-06-25

- Switched to Module::Build, which should fix the installation
  problems caused by very long Makefile lines on some platforms.

- Fixed a bug in finding the correct data for a given datetime.  This
  could occur when calling set_time_zone on an object that was very
  close to a DST transition, though it only affected some time zones
  in a few specific circumstances.  Reported by Ben Bennett.


0.20     2003-06-20

- Load File::Spec in DT::TZ::Local.  Reported by John Siracusa.


0.19     2003-06-13

- The name() method will now always return something that can be used
  to recreate the original object by calling
  DateTime::TimeZone->new().  The only class which changed was
  DT::TZ::Floating, but the fact that name() is guaranteed to work in
  recreating the object is an API change.


0.18     2003-06-06

- Switched the internal data structure for the Olson database to use
  array references instead of hash references.  This seems to save a
  reduce memory usage to about 66% of the hash based version.
  Additionally, the files themselves have gotten much smaller.  This
  was all partially based on a patch by Eugene van der Pijll.


0.17     2003-05-25

- Fixed test failures on system where /etc/localtime is not a symlink.
  Diagnosed by Iain Truskett.

- We look in more places to determine the local time zone:
-- Check for /etc/timezone file.
-- Check for /etc/sysconfig/clock file.  Patch from Rick Measham.
   Testing help from Ben Bennett.

- Added is_olson method so object created from a named Olson database
  time zone can be distinguished from other types of objects.


0.16     2003-05-07

- Fixed a bug where a POSIX time zone in $ENV{TZ} could cause the code
  to try to load a module named something like
  "DateTime::TimeZone::5.0::03".

- The feature which attempts to read /etc/localtime to determine the
  time zone was broken.  Reported by John Siracusa.


0.15     2003-05-05

- Fixed some bugs in calculations of offsets for future datetimes
  could be incorrect.  This also quiets some warnings from
  DateTime.pm's time zone tests.


0.14     2003-05-05

- Make sure tests always run with warnings on.

- The were major bugs in handling time zones where the second to last
  observance had "infinite" rules (rules where the "TO" field is
  "max") and the last observance did not specify rules.  An example of
  this is America/Belem.

- Fixed a bug in the generated time zone code that caused it to do
  more work than it should when calculating offsets for future
  datetimes.


0.13     2003-05-03

- Fixed DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly constructor so that it only
  accepts valid offsets.  Previously, invalid offsets like "foo" were
  turned into zero internally.

- Made "local" look for /etc/localtime symlink as part of determining
  local time zone.

- Added a links() function to DateTime::TimeZone.

- Included all the links from Olson db file named backwards, which
  includes things like "US/Central".

- When searching for the current offset based on the local time, we
  now prefer the later of the two offsets rather than the earlier.
  Otherwise, offset shifts larger than a day can cause some very
  strange problems when doing date math.

- DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly objects now return the offset in
  string form when their name() or short_name_for_datetime() methods
  are called.  Suggested by Rick Measham.


0.12     2003-04-12

- Updated to latest Olson database (2003a).

- Fixed a bug in handling time zones with only one historical offset,
  like Pacific/Johnston.


0.11     2003-03-26  the "Asia/Baghdad release"

- Fixed two bugs, both of which made some time zones unusable..  One
  affected time zones that do not have any DST changes, and the other
  affected time zones that have exactly two historical offsets (one of
  which would be the current offset), such as Pacific/Tarawa.
  Reported by Eric Cholet.


0.10     2003-03-20

- Fixed a bug in the DateTime::TimeZone::offset_as_seconds bug when
  trying given a negative number that resulted in an offset that
  included minutes (not a whole hour).  Found by Flavio Glock.


0.09     2003-02-26

- Fixed an infinite recursion bug in generating future time zone data
  that occurred when $ENV{TZ} was something like "America/Chicago".
  Sort of reported by Eugene van der Pijll ;)


0.08     2003-02-22

- Fix handling of "local" time zone so that it passes a string to the
  OffsetOnly constructor instead of a number.  Reported by Eric
  Cholet.

- Fix DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly documentation to specify that
  offset must be specified as string, not a number.


0.07     2003-02-19

- Skip tests unless DateTime.pm 0.06 is installed.  Otherwise we have
  a bootstrapping problem since DateTime 0.06 needs DateTime::TimeZone
  0.06+.


0.06     2003-02-16

- Changes to work with DateTime.pm 0.06.

- DateTime::TimeZone::offset_as_seconds handles '0' properly.

- Fix a bug in handling future times for time zones with recurring
  rules.  The symptom would be the error "Invalid local time for date
  ..."

- Time zone data is now stored in a simple array, and searched using a
  binary search algorithm.  This eliminates the need to install
  Tree::RedBlack, and makes looking up time zone data quicker.
  Suggested by Jonathan Peacock.


0.05     2003-02-13

- The offset_as_string function did not handle negative offsets
  properly.  Patch from Kellan Elliott-McCrea.

- Allow 'Z' as an offset name, equivalent to 'UTC'.  Patch from
  Kellan Elliott-McCrea.

- Make sure DT::TZ subclasses which need to override
  is_dst_for_datetime do so.

- Changed offset_as_seconds and offset_as_string so that the former
  always assumes its arg is a string and the latter always assumes it
  got a number.


0.04     2003-02-10

- Be forgiving of bad names in $ENV{TZ} and just calculate local
  offset instead.


0.03     2003-02-09

- Fixed bug in new method that should have caused DateTime::TimeZone
  to not be loadable.

- Added is_dst_for_datetime method.


0.02     2003-02-09

- Updated version number to non-dev-release so that it's visible when
  CPAN.pm looks for it as a prereq to DateTime.pm.  Otherwise
  identical to 0.02 and still alpha/beta-ish.


0.01_01  2003-02-06

- Don't make pod for generated timezone modules.

- Fix a buglet that caused test 01load.t to fail with some versions of
  Test::More.  Reported by John Peacock.


0.01_00  2003-02-04

- Initial alpha release
