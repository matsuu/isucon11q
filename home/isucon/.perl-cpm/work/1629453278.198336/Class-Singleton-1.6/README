NAME

    Class::Singleton - Implementation of a "Singleton" class

SYNOPSIS

    use Class::Singleton;

    my $one = Class::Singleton->instance();   # returns a new instance
    my $two = Class::Singleton->instance();   # returns same instance

DESCRIPTION

    This is the Class::Singleton module. A Singleton describes an object class
    that can have only one instance in any system. An example of a Singleton
    might be a print spooler or system registry. This module implements a
    Singleton class from which other classes can be derived. By itself, the
    Class::Singleton module does very little other than manage the instantiation
    of a single object. In deriving a class from Class::Singleton, your module
    will inherit the Singleton instantiation method and can implement whatever
    specific functionality is required.
