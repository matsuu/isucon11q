NAME
    Stream::Buffered - temporary buffer to save bytes

SYNOPSIS
      my $buf = Stream::Buffered->new($length);
      $buf->print($bytes);

      my $size = $buf->size;
      my $fh   = $buf->rewind;

DESCRIPTION
    Stream::Buffered is a buffer class to store arbitrary length of byte
    strings and then get a seekable filehandle once everything is buffered.
    It uses PerlIO and/or temporary file to save the buffer depending on the
    length of the size.
