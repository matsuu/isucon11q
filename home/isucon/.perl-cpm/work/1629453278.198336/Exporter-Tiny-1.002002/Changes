1.002002	2020-04-24

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Bug in handling regexps in import lists; Exporter::Tiny allowed regexps
   like /foo/i but not /foo/. Having trailing flags is now optional!

 - Tests would fail if `PERL5OPT=-Mfeature=:5.18` environment variable was
   set. This is because bareword `-default` was being interpreted as the
   Perl `default` keyword.
