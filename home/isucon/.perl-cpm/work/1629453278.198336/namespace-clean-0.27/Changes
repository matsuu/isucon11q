        - Allow packages to be cleaned multiple times
        - Ensure the debugger workarounds are applied only when
          DB::sub is actively used (they are superfluous otherwise)
        - Work around P5#72210, resulting in fails on 5.8.8 -Duselongdouble
        - Fix incorrect name in META (RT#107813)

0.26  2015-10-07 17:43 (UTC)
        - Exclusively use Package::Stash::PP on perls < 5.8.7 until a fixed
          Package::Stash::XS ships - breakage keeps getting reintroduced
          ( RT#107343, RT#74151 )
        - Explicitly document the late runtime binding of `sort SUBNAME ...`
          ( RT#101247 )
        - No longer rely on Sub::Identify - either use Sub::Util or B
          ( should solve RT#96945 )


0.25  2014-03-05 11:27 (UTC)
        - Fix incorrect ExtUtils::CBuilder detection routine leading to
          Makefile.PL crashes when EU::CB is not available


0.24  2012-12-04 22:59 (UTC)
        - Properly skip debugger test when optional deps not available
        - Make sure pure-perl tests pass correctly on space-containing
          paths (RT#77528)
        - Remove all the pure-perl fallback code and depend on PP-capable
          B::H::EOS 0.12


0.23  2012-03-11 15:06 (UTC)
        - Rely on B::Hooks::EndOfScope version 0.10 to fix issues with
          new Module::Runtime versions (>= 0.012) on perl 5.10 due
          to incorrect hook firing due to %^H localisation.
        - Fix failures on 5.13.6 due to incorrect version number threshold
          (RT#74683)


0.22 (official fix of all the %^H ickyness)  2011-12-26 13:04 (UTC)
        - Simplify the >= 5.10 PP variant even more - move the hook from
          DESTROY into DELETE
        - Force explicit callback invocation order on 5.8 PP


0.21_02  2011-12-22 11:33 (UTC)
        - Replace the %^H tie approach with fieldhashes, fixes all known
          corner cases and caveats on supported perls >= 5.8.1 (FC)
        - Compile away the debugger fixup on perls >= 5.15.5 (FC)


0.21_01  2011-12-21 11:39 (UTC)
        - More robust handling of the tied %^H in pure perl mode (RT#73402)
        - Limit the debugger workarounds to perls between 5.8.8 and 5.14,
          extend debugger support to all perl versions (FC) (RT#69862)
        - If possible, automatically install (but not load) the debugger
          workaround libraries on perls between 5.8.8 and 5.14 (RT#72368)
        - Add back dropped NAME section (RT#70259)


0.21  2011-08-03 21:51 (UTC)
        - When using the tie() fallback ensure we do not obliterate a
          foreign tie()
        - Better document how to disable the tie() fallback


0.20_01 (the "mst made me do it" release)   2011-07-31 09:26 (UTC)
        - Only invoke the deleted sub stashing if we run udner a debugger
          (avoid runtime penalty of Sub::Name/Sub::Identify)
        - Spellfixes (RT#54388)
        - When B::Hooks::EndOfScope is not available, switch to a simple
          tie() of %^H. While it can not 100% replace B::H::EOS, it does
          everything n::c needs


0.20  2011-01-06 18:07 (UTC)
        - Bump Package::Stash dependency to 0.22 to pull in a bugfix in
          Package::Stash::XS 0.19.


0.19  2011-01-03 16:36 (UTC)
        - Port to the new Package::Stash 0.18 API and depend on it.
        - Don't rely on package::stash's remove_package_symbol implementation
          (doy).


0.18  2010-06-13 17:12 (UTC)
        - Make sure we continue working on future Package::Stash
          versions (doy).


0.17  2010-06-05 23:16 (UTC)
        - Make sure the debugger author test is skipped for
          non-authors before the debugger is even loaded.


0.16  2010-06-05 20:53 (UTC)
        - Release all changes of 0.15 as part of a stable release.
        - Convert from Module::Install to Dist::Zilla.

        - Disable auto_install.
        - Turn the error prone debugger test into an author test.


0.13  2010-01-17 02:40:48 (CET)
        - Skip failing debugger tests on 5.8.8 and older.


0.12  2010-01-14 03:22:03 (CET)

          (Zefram).
        - Work around $DB::sub (Yuval Kogman).
        - Fix restoring of non-code symbols when cleaning (Ben Morrows).


0.11  2009-03-03 17:34:49 (CET)
        - Added -cleanee option to specify the package to clean (Closes
          RT#41850).
        - Added n:c->clean_subroutines($cleanee, @subs).


0.10  2009-02-20 14:31:36 (CET)
        - Depend on B::Hooks::EndOfScope 0.07 to avoid segfaults and lost error
          messages when something goes wrong.


0.09  2008-10-22 17:48:49 (CEST)
        - Use B::Hooks::EndOfScope instead of %^H + Scope::Guard.


0.08  2008-03-09 22:01:01 (CET)

0.06  2008-02-20 15:09:00 (CET)
        - Fixed 'uninitialized value in ref-to-glob cast' error
