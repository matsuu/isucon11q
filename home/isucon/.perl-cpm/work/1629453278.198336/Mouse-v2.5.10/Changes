    * Remove an optional depenency, Data::Util.
      This is used to make method modifiers faster, but the effect

      and sometimes the difference caused problems.

    SUMMARY

    [BUG FIXES]
    * Mouse::Object::DESTROY could cause SEGVs
    * Attribute triggers could cause panics
    * Integers > 2**32 were not groked as Int
    * Incorrect types, e.g. "Array[Int", was accepted
    * Metaclass compatibility was sometimes ignored

    [MOOSE COMPATIBILITY]
    * before/around/after accept regular expressions
    * has() becomes strict
    * the global destruction flag is passed to DEMOLISH methods
    * Delegations can be curried
    * Built-in type constraints have the same hierarchy as Moose's


0.50_09 Mon Mar 15 12:02:28 2010
    * (re)fix RT #55048 to grok 2**46+0.5 as Int, but
      accept 2**46 as Int even on 32 bit environments;
      note that an Int is exactly what is matched to /^[+-]?[0-9]+$/,
      so 10e100 will not be groked as Int (gfx)

0.50_08 Thu Mar 11 19:28:58 2010
    * Makefile.PL
        - Resolved #55419: Add Devel::PPPort to build_requires (gfx)
    * Mouse::Exporter
        - Turns on warnings FATAL => 'recursion' by default (gfx)
    * Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints
        - Change the type parser to check syntax (gfx)
          (Now it throws erros to "ArrayRef[]", "ArrayRef[Int", etc.)

0.50_07 Sun Mar  7 19:59:37 2010
    * Mouse::Meta::Attribute
        - Fix a possible panic, caused by triggers, reported by
          Nobuo Danjou (gfx)

    * Mouse::PurePerl
        - Fix an issue on metaclass compatibility again (gfx)
        - Fix more-than-32-bit-int progrem again (gfx)

0.50_05 Mon Mar  1 11:18:26 2010
    * Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints
        - Mouse used an incorrect cast at the C-level which meant that
          its idea of numbers was different from that of Perl's (and
          Mouse's). Notably > 2**32 Integers on 32 bit systems didn't
          work, RT #55048 (AEvar).
    * Mouse::Meta::Classs
        - Fix an issue on metaclass compatibility (gfx)

0.50_04 Fri Feb 26 18:57:24 2010
    * All
        - Warnings are less noisy, as shown by example/warns.pl (gfx)
        - Various optimization and refactoring (gfx)

0.50_03 Mon Feb 22 17:56:47 2010
    * Mouse::Meta::Attribute
        - Catch up about Moose 0.84 about warnings (gfx)
          - If an attribute generates no accessors, it will be warned
          - If both 'isa' and 'does' are specified and 'isa' does not do
            'does', then it will be warned
    * Mouse::Object
        - Fix a possible segv which is caused by destructors (gfx)
    * Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints
        - Implement the built-in type hierarchy (gfx)

0.50_02 Sat Feb 20 14:37:16 2010
    * Mouse::Meta::Attribute
        - Implement argument currying for delegation (gfx)
    * Mouse::Meta::Method::Constructor
        - Implement strict constructors experimentally, which will warn
          unkown constructor arguments (gfx)

    * Implemented stub augment and inner functions for Mouse::Role,
      which merely throw an exception as in Moose::Role. (wu-lee)

      yet; the rest have been moved to 020_roles/failing for later

    * Implemented Mouse::Role->does_role.  This does not yet quite
      seem to pass all the tests it should. (wu-lee)

      setting an explicit true value at the end of a source file. (obra)

0.15 Thu Feb 5 11:44:05 2009
    * Don't export Mouse's sugar into the package 'main'

    * Rename Mouse::TypeRegistry to Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints

    * "type" sugar for when you're not subtyping anything

    * Keep track of the source package of each type

    * Borrow more of Moose's meta API

    * Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints now uses Exporter so you can select which
      sugar you want

    * class_type shouldn't load the class (Moose compat; no easy fix :/)

    * use Data::Util to make method modifiers fast if it's available (dann)

0.13 Tue Dec 16 02:01:40 2008
    * Pass in the instance to the default sub in the constructor (reported with
      failing tests by rjbs)

    * Tons of new features implemented by tokuhirom++ and Yappo++:
      - method API in classes and roles!
      - "requires" and "with" for Mouse::Role
      - Type coercion
      - Inject a constructor after make_immutable. Huge speedup!
      - class_type and role_type
      - Inject a destructor for more speedup
      - MouseX::Types (may move into its own dist)
      - create_anon_class
      - union type constraints (eg 'Str | Undef')
      - subtypes and sugar for them

0.12 Thu Dec 4 19:23:10 2008
    * Provide Test::Exception function unless it's version 0.27 - RT #41254

    * Mouse::Util now provides dies_ok

    * Make class-like types behave more like Moose; subclasses OK! (rjbs)

    * Steal more tests from Moose

0.11 Sun Nov 2 11:35:04 2008
    * Throw an error if accessor/predicate/clearer/handles code eval fails

    * Optimizations for generated methods, they should now be on par with Moose

0.10 Tue Oct 28 19:23:07 2008
    * Require a recent Moose (which has the bugfix) for
      t/500_moose_extends_mouse.t

0.09 Sun Sep 28 22:37:13 2008
    * Initial version of Mouse::Tiny, a one-file concatenation of the Mouse
      classes for easy embedding

    * Fixes caused by test failures (Carp not being loaded, Moose being
      required in a test)

0.08 Sun Sep 28 12:46:07 2008
    * ALL dependencies have been removed!

    * Fixes for Class::Method::Modifiers being required for testing

0.07 Sun Sep 28 00:19:07 2008
    * All runtime dependencies have been removed! The only change in
      functionality (hopefully) is that the Sub::Exporter features can no
      longer be used (we've backed down to regular Exporter). Scalar::Util is
      required for "weaken" support, and Class::Method::Modifiers is required
      for method modifier support, but only if you use these features!
      Having Scalar::Util and MRO::Compat installed will provide only
      performance increases.

    * Tests and fixes for extending a Mouse class with Moose (nothingmuch)

    * Support for adding method modifiers to a role, and composing them into
      classes (we'll get true methods some day)

    * Method modifiers now go through the metaclass instead of invoking
      Class::Method::Modifiers directly

    * Remove the deprecated before/after/around triggers

    * Roles keywords 'requires' and 'excludes' now throw errors instead of
      silently doing nothing (they aren't implemented yet)

0.06 Thu Jul 23 02:10:07 2008
    * Deprecating before/after/around triggers! Switch back to coderef +
      whatever you used to do. Moose is have it implemented it as an extension
      trait.

    * Mouse
      - updated trigger doc (thanks perigrin)
        - which will not see CPAN :( sorry perigrin!

    * Mouse::Meta::Class
      - add a make_immutable method which does nothing(!), for even more
        Moose compat (nothingmuch's idea)

0.05 Thu Jul 17 01:53:20 2008
    * Mouse::Role
      Mouse::Meta::Role
      Mouse
      Squirrel::Role

      Mouse::Object
      - Add clone_object and clone_instance (nothingmuch)

    * Mouse::Object
      - Add BUILDARGS (nothingmuch)

    * Everywhere
      - Improvements to the MOP (e.g. Class->add_method)

    * (build)
      - Excise dependency on Test::Warn, we only used it in one simple test
