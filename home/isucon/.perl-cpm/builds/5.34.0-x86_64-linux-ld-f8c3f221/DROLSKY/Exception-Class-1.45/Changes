1.45    2021-05-02

- The field names for an exception are now checked to ensure that they are
  valid Perl identifiers. Implemented by brian d foy. PR #13.


1.44    2017-12-10

- You can now pass "frame_filter", "filter_frames_early", and "skip_frames" to
  the throw() method of an exception class. These will be passed on to the
  Devel::StackTrace constructor. Requested by Frédéric Brière. GH #6.


1.43    2017-07-09

- The full_message() method in Exception::Class::Base now calls message()
  instead of accessing the object's hash key. This makes it easier to override
  message() in a subclass. Patch by Alexander Batyrshin. PR #11.


1.42    2017-01-04

- Generated exception classes are now added to %INC. If you subclass a
  generated class with "use base" then base.pm will no longer attempt to load
  the requested class. Patch by Todd Rinaldo. PR #8.


1.41    2016-12-07

- Switch to GitHub Issues.


1.40    2016-01-29

- Fixed broken metadata. Reported by Slaven Rezić. GitHub #3.


1.39    2014-11-01

- Replaced the Exception::Class::Base->NoRefs method with UnsafeRefCapture to
  match changes in Devel::StackTrace 2.00. The old method is deprecated but
  will continue to work.


1.38    2014-05-05

- An exception without a message will now default to either the associated
  exception class description or the string "[Generic exception]". Patch by
  Ricardo Signes. PR #2.

- Added field_hash() and context_hash() methods. Patch by Ricardo Signes. PR
  #1.


1.37    2013-02-24

- I now recommend you use Throwable instead of this module. It has a nicer,
  more modern interface.

- Fixed various bugs and confusion in the docs.


1.36    2012-11-17

- Fixed some stupidity in the tests that appears to have been highlighted by
  recent changes to Devel::StackTrace. Reported by Dan Horne. RT #81245.


1.35    2012-09-17

- Require Class::Data::Inheritable 0.02+.


1.34    2012-09-16

- 1.33 did not declare any prereqs. Oops. Reported by Roham McGovern. RT
  #79677.


1.33    2012-09-16

- Fixed warning from basic.t on 5.17.x. RT #79121.


1.32    2010-06-28

- Removed Test::Most dependency, which was causing a circular dependency
  chain. Reported by Burak Gursoy. RT #58889.


1.31    2010-06-26

- Made it possible to use Exception::Class::Base without loading
  Exception::Class. Reported by Alex Peters. RT #57269.


1.30    2010-03-20

- Added the ability to create light weight exceptions, which don't record a
  stack trace or any other context info (time, pid, etc.). This is done by
  setting $class->NoContextInfo to a true value for the exception class. Based
  on a patch by Graham Barr. RT #54826.


1.29    2009-05-08

- Make sure that there is only one line that the toolchain can pick up
  when looking for this module's $VERSION.


1.28    2009-05-06

* Removed Exception::Class::Base->do_trace and ->NoObjectRefs, both of
  which have been undocumented for many years.

- Moved Exception::Class::Base to its own file, so it doesn't
  overwrite the $VERSION in Exception::Class (and for general
  sanity). Reported by Kirk Baucom.


1.27    2009-05-04

* The error message for an exception no longer defaults to $!. This
  was a bad idea, and has bitten some people. Addresses RT #43600.

* I'm now only supporting Perl 5.8.1+. This module broke on 5.6.2 (and
  5.8.0) at some point and I don't really care enough to fix
  it. Non-intrusive patches to make it work on 5.8.0 or less (again)
  will be accepted.


1.26    2008-10-25

- No code changes, just bumped the Devel::StackTrace dependency to
  1.20.

  The changes in 1.25 exposed a bug in Devel::StackTrace which has now
  been fixed. This caused HTML::Mason test failures, among other
  things. Reported by Andreas Koenig.


1.25    2008-10-21

- The Exception::Class::Base constructor no longer looks at the
  associated Devel::StackTrace object's frames. Avoiding looking at
  the frames should make constructing exception objects much
  faster. Instead the information based on the stack trace frames -
  package(), file(), and line() - is only retrieved when it is
  requested. Patch by Ruslan Zakirov. RT #40221.


1.24    2008-03-30

- Added a MaxArgLength class parameter to go along with the new
  max_arg_length constructor param for Devel::StackTrace
  objects. Patch by Ian Burrell.


1.23    2006-01-14

- Fix code bugs in the SYNOPSIS.

- Exception::Class->caught() now returns $@ if not given an argument.


1.22    2005-09-30

- Added Exception::Class::Base->caught() so you can write
  "My::Error->caught()".  Apparently this is what Damian documented in
  Perl Best Practices.  Thanks to JD Hedden for pointing this out.

- Require Devel::StackTrace 1.12 to fix a test failure on Win32.
  Reported by Garrett Goebel.


1.21    2005-04-17

- Added Exception::Class->caught() as syntactic sugar for catching
  exceptions in a "safe" manner.  See the docs for details.  Suggested
  by Damian Conway.


1.20    2005-01-01

- Moved the Classes() method to Exception::Class, now as a function,
  which is where it really belongs.  Also corrected the docs for this
  function, as they incorrectly implied that it would return all
  subclasses, instead of just subclasses which were created when
  loading Exception::Class.

- Added a Build.PL file, and releases are now signed with
  Module::Signature.

- Added ignore_class and ignore_package constructor parameters.  Patch
  by Daisuke Maki.


1.19    2004-03-10

- Identical to 1.18 except that it requires Devel::StackTrace 1.10,
  which fixes a failure in this package's test when run with Perl
  5.6.1.  Reported by Jesse Erlbaum.


1.18    2004-02-21

- Added RespectOverload class method, which can be used to control the
  respect_overload parameter for Devel::StackTrace objects.


1.17    2004-02-20

- Document that new() is always called to create an
  Exception::Class::Base object.  Suggested by Steve Hay.

- Fix a test that failed with Devel::StackTrace 1.05.  Basically, the
  test expected output from Devel::StackTrace that reflected a bug
  that was fixed in 1.05.  Reported by Jesse Vincent.


1.16    2003-09-25

- David Wheeler's patch exposed a bug in Devel::StackTrace which could
  cause exceptions to not have any value set for package, file, or
  line.  This is fixed by depending on Devel::StackTrace 1.04.  This
  release is otherwise identical to 1.15.  Reported by Steve Hay.


1.15    2003-09-17

- Exceptions thrown from an alias subroutine always had
  "Exception::Class" as their package name.  Patch by David Wheeler.


1.14    2003-07-04

- ** BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY **
  NoRefs is now true by default.  This means that stacktraces will
  _not_ store references unless you explicitly set NoRefs to a false
  value.  This is done because it's too easy to leak memory when
  references are saved in stack traces.

- Fixed a very odd bug where Exception::Class could mistakenly think
  that an exception class had been created when it really hadn't.
  This was only exposed with bleadperl (5.8.1-to-be), and is unlikely
  to affect anyone using an existing Perl version.


1.13    2003-06-21

- Documented the Exception::Class::Base->Fields method, which can be
  called on subclasses to determine what extra fields they have
  defined.  Suggested by Chris Winters.


1.12    2003-04-03

- Added the Exception::Class::Base->Classes method.  Patch by David
  Wheeler.


1.11    2003-02-20

- A description containing a single quote or backslash would cause a
  syntax error in the code generated by Exception::Class.  Patch by
  Luc St-Louis.


1.10    2003-01-28

- The alias feature had a bug that showed up when an alias was
  assigned to a class whose parent had not yet been made.


1.09    2003-01-22

- Tweak to Fields method so that it returns empty list for 5.6.1 and
  5.00503.

- Require Devel::StackTrace 1.03 to fix potential recursion problem
  between the two classes when stringifying exceptions.


1.08    2003-01-21

- Added "alias" feature, which allows you to create a subroutine that
  throws a specified exception.  This is based on code created by Ken
  Williams for Mason.


1.07    2002-09-19

- Forgot to require Devel::StackTrace 1.01.


1.06    2002-09-19

- Use File::Spec when testing file method so that test 7 passes on all
  platforms.  Reported by Ron Savage.

- Use Test::More for test suite.

- Change NoObjectRefs method to NoRefs, to match change in
  Devel::StackTrace 1.01.  The old method is deprecated, but will
  continue to work.  However, it now _means_ the same thing as NoRefs.


1.05    2002-08-23

- Add NoObjectRefs class method to prevent Devel::StackTrace from
  holding onto objects internally, thus delaying destruction.  Based
  on a discussion with Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.


1.04    2002-08-22

- Fix messed up tarball as reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.


1.03    2002-08-21

- Some versions of Perl may give an error about "Ambiguous call
  resolved as CORE::time()".  This should be fixed now.  Reported by
  Ron Savage.


1.02    2002-08-20

- Fields set in a parent class were not actually being inherited by
  children.  Patch (with tests!) by David Wheeler.

- Allow a single argument (error/message) to the constructor.  Patch
  by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.

- General doc cleanup.


1.01    2002-05-23

- Make sure that exception objects always test as true in a boolean
  context.


1.00    2002-03-08

- Added a full_message method intended to be overridden when you
  create a subclass that uses fields that you want included in the
  stringification of the object.  Suggested by Jon Swartz.


0.99    2002-03-06

- The much-requested "arbitrary attributes" feature has been added.
  Thanks to Jon Swartz for the patch.  You can now do this:

  use Exception::Class ( 'My::Exception' => { fields => [ 'bar', 'baz' ] } );

  ...

  if ( UNIVERSAL::isa( $@, 'My::Exception' ) { print $@->bar, $@->baz; }


0.98    2002-02-20

- Subclasses that overrode the ->as_string method had to repeat the
  stringification overloading for exception objects.  This has been
  changed so that the stringification overloading is now

  sub { $_[0]->as_string }

  Suggested by Jon Swartz.


0.97    2001-11-25

- Incorporated a patch from Ken Williams that works around several
  Perl 5.6.0 bugs.

- Test 31 was explicitly different for 5.6.0.  Ken said that the
  difference actually made it fail (whereas in the past for me it
  succeeded).  Tweak this test a bit more to just be more flexible
  under 5.6.0.


0.96    2001-11-23

- Changes wasn't in MANIFEST.  Oops.

- Doc tweaks and cleanup of README.

- Make do_trace a synonym to Trace for backwards compatibility.


0.95    2001-11-22

  ** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE **

- Remove do_trace method and replace it with Trace method, which is
  inherited by subclasses.

- Exception object now always have a Devel::StackTrace object
  available.  The Trace method only determines whether or not it is
  included when the exception is stringified.

- A new parameter show_trace for throw which allows you to override
  the value of Trace on a case by case basis.

- Fix uninit value warning with 5.00503.


0.90    2001-10-23

- fix buglet reported by Terrence Brannon that could occur while
  trying to figure out where the exception was thrown, if the
  exception was thrown from the package that the exception is an
  object of.

- doc improvements suggested Nathaniel Smith (related to using
  Error.pm) and Mark Stosberg.
  

0.85    Unknown Release Date

- added ability to use message instead of error as hash key to
  constructor.


0.8     2000-09-03

- changed object from psuedo-hash to regular hash

- added package, file, & line methods to exception object.

- added more tests for exception object accessors


0.7     2000-09-03

- hack in test.pl to allow tests to pass under 5.6.0.

- README details various Perl bugs this module (along with
  Devel::StackTrace) can expose and some possible workarounds.


0.6     2000-06-27

- renamed to Exception::Class


0.5     2000-06-26

- Initial release, as Class::Exceptions.
