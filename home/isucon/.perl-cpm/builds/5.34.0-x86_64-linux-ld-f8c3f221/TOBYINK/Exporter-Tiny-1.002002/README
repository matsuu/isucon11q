NAME
    Exporter::Tiny - an exporter with the features of Sub::Exporter but only
    core dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       package MyUtils;
       use base "Exporter::Tiny";
       our @EXPORT = qw(frobnicate);
       sub frobnicate { ... }
       1;

       package MyScript;
       use MyUtils "frobnicate" => { -as => "frob" };
       print frob(42);
       exit;

DESCRIPTION
    Exporter::Tiny supports many of Sub::Exporter's external-facing features
    including renaming imported functions with the `-as`, `-prefix` and
    `-suffix` options; explicit destinations with the `into` option; and
    alternative installers with the `installer` option. But it's written in
    only about 40% as many lines of code and with zero non-core dependencies.

    Its internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration
    done through the @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS package variables.
