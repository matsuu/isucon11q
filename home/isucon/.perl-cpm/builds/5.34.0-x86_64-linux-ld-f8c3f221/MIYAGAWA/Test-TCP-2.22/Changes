        don't run command when the port is empty

        Test::TCP do hack on Windows for checking port used.

        https://github.com/tokuhirom/Test-TCP/commit/0f4510d8

        But this way always return 0 with succeeded with empty port. This is not
        expected behavior. So this change fix to call check_port if the port is
        not defined.

        fixes #60

        Ensure that IO::Socket::IP is DESTROY'd before can_bind returns
        
        be316f1f worked around a core perl bug[1] which causes Perl < 5.24.0
        to DESTROY the IO::Socket::IP object too late, causing the empty port
        to not actually be empty if it was used immediately.
        
        Unfortunately, this change was lost in ba745fd1, which again put the
        return of `can_bind` on the stack along with the actual return value,
        re-instating the bug.
        
        Split the statement across two statements again, and add a comment on
        the importance of preserving it.

    Old versions of Test::SharedFork are incompatibles with the new Test::Builder: I had "missing TB2::History" errors.
    It would be helpful to upgrade the Test::SharedFork dependency to help the user to avoid to encounter such hard to track deep errors.

    commit 8259d5eb28919bc766c8b500151d5be7e944b7f2
    Author: Petr Písař <ppisar@redhat.com>
    Date:   Fri Jun 27 13:37:20 2014 +0200

        Wait infinitely if max_wait is negative

        The t/12_pass_wait_port_options.t will fail if the server process does not
        start listening in max_wait limit. This can happen if the host is
        loaded or just if the scheduler decides to postpone the process.

        This patch adds possibility to wait infitely by passing a negative
        max_wait value to the Test::TCP object and it changes the
        t/12_pass_wait_port_options.t test to use this feature.

2.01 2013-09-22T04:13:53Z

    [Changes from MITHALDU (Christian Walde)]
    - test waitport argument by running full code-chain, not with partial mocking
        
    - The partial mocks cause stuck forks on win32 at times, causing the test to
      hang. With the full code chain present the test runs reliably

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
    - Change wait_port() API to take max_wait seconds, and wait exponentially.

    [Changes from MITHALDU (Christian Walde)]

    - fix port checking on Win32 by performing it in another process
        
    - On Win32 fork is emulating by creating another thread in the same process.
      This leads to a possible bug/race condition when a server tries to open a
      port and listen on it, while in the same process a client tries to connect
      to the same port. This manifests by the accept call of the server failing
      with an error of "Bad file descriptor".

      This is easily fixed by having another process perform the port checking,
      since that will not interfere with the internals.
