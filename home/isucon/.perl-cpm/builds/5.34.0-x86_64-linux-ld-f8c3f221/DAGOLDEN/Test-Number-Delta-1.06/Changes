Revision history for Perl module Test::Number::Delta

1.06      2014-11-25 07:09:08-05:00 America/New_York

    [Fixed]

    - Make 0 and 0 compare equal with a relative epsilon

    [Documented]

    - Added SEE ALSO with Number::Tolerant and Test::Deep::NumberTolerant

1.05      2014-11-24 11:08:11-05:00 America/New_York

    [Fixed]

    - relative comparison of array reference elements now works as intended

    - diagnostics of delta_not_ok and delta_not_within clarified under
      relative comparison

1.04      2013-11-20 18:43:32 America/New_York

    - Modernized distribution metadata and licensing

    - Distribution now managed with Dist::Zilla

1.03 Sun Sep  3 03:21:59 EDT 2006
    - fixed logic errors for delta_not_*
    - changed epsilon restriction to just non-zero; negative epsilons are
      the same as positive
    
1.02 Tue Aug 29 05:37:53 EDT 2006
    - added error checking to ensure that values of epsilon are always positive
    - added delta_not_within() and delta_not_ok() for inequality checking

1.01 Thu Jul 27 11:34:29 EDT 2006
    - changed comparison to less than epsilon, as checking "equal to"
      epsilon is, of course, not robust for floating point numbers
      
1.00 Tue Jul 25 18:19:51 EDT 2006
    - bumped version to 1.00 to indicate "release" status
