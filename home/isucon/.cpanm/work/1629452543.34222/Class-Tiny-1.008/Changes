    [DOCUMENTATION]

    - DEMOLISH docs incorrectly claimed that errors were thrown.  Updated to

1.005     2016-09-06 12:12:06-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [INTERNAL]

    - Optimize generated accessors (5% to 25% faster depending on
      combination of read vs write and default vs no-default).

    [INTERNAL]

    - Refactored accessor generation to allow subclasses of Class::Tiny
      to implement alternate accessors.

1.001     2015-01-30 21:13:07-05:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added support for BUILDARGS for Moo(se) compatibility

    [INTERNAL]

    - Implements BUILDALL via method (was inline) for Moo(se) compatibility

1.000     2014-07-16 09:55:29-04:00 America/New_York

    [*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ***]

    - Attributes for custom accessors *MUST* be declared for them to be
      set via the constructor.  It is no longer sufficient for a method of
      the same name to exist.

    - Unknown constructor arguments are ignored rather than fatal; they are
      not included in the object.  Special instructions for using BUILD to
      hide constructor arguments from validation are irrelevant and have
      been removed.

    - These changes make Class::Tiny-based classes easier to subclass by
      more advanced object frameworks like Moose or Moo.

      and attribute defaults under subclassing

    [INTERNAL]

    - added tests for multiple inheritance

0.011     2013-09-25 11:08:07 America/New_York

    [PREREQS]

0.008     2013-09-08 09:49:46 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - META.yml encoding problems

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - revised CONTRIBUTING

    [INTERNAL]

    - refactored precaching

0.007     2013-09-07 16:48:56 America/New_York

    [OPTIMIZED]

    - accessors without defaults are now much faster (comparable
      to Class::Accessor::Fast)

    - constructor and destructors are slightly faster when there
      are no superclasses except Class::Tiny::Object

    - linearized @ISA and other items are cached for speed when
      the first object is created

0.006     2013-09-05 11:56:48 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - added introspection method: get_all_attribute_defaults_for($class)

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Fixed TOBYINK email address for contributors list

    - Revised rationale for why Class::Tiny vs other modules

0.005     2013-08-28 11:51:37 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Attributes now support lazy defaults passed as a hash reference
      to the class declaration

0.004     2013-08-21 16:38:01 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Base class is now Class::Tiny::Object; Class::Tiny is now only the
      class builder

    - BUILD and DEMOLISH now have Moo(se) like semantics: BUILD gets
      original constructor arguments. DEMOLISH is now passed a global
      destruction flag (requires Devel::GlobalDestruction on Perls before
      v5.14)

    - Constructor argument validation now happens after BUILD.

    - Constructor argument validation has been softened to a heuristic:
      argument names must match a method name

    [ADDED]

    - added introspection method: get_all_attributes_for($class)

    [INTERNAL]

    - Refactored import() for easier subclassing of Class::Tiny should
      anyone be crazy enough to do so

0.003     2013-08-19 19:43:36 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Multiple invocations of "use Class::Tiny" in a package accumulate
      attributes instead of overwriting them

0.002     2013-08-19 17:17:24 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Slight reduction in memory usage tracking attributes

0.001     2013-08-16 10:48:33 America/New_York

    - First release
