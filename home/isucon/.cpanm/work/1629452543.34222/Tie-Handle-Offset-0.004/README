NAME
    Tie::Handle::Offset - Tied handle that hides the beginning of a file

VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::Handle::Offset;

      tie *FH, 'Tie::Handle::Offset', "<", $filename, { offset => 20 };

DESCRIPTION
    This modules provides a file handle that hides the beginning of a file.
    After opening, the file is positioned at the offset location. "seek()"
    and "tell()" calls are modified to preserve the offset.

    For example, "tell($fh)" will return 0, though the actual file position
    is at the offset. Likewise, "seek($fh,80,0)" will seek to 80 bytes from
    the offset instead of 80 bytes from the actual start of the file.
