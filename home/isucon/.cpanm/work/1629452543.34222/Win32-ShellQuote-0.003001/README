NAME
    Win32::ShellQuote - Quote argument lists for Win32

SYNOPSIS
        use Win32::ShellQuote qw(:all);

        system quote_system('program.exe', '--switch', 'argument with spaces or other special characters');

DESCRIPTION
    Quotes argument lists to be used in Win32 in several different
    situations.

    Windows passes its arguments as a single string instead of an array as
    other platforms do. In almost all cases, the standard Win32
    CommandLineToArgvW
    <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms647232.aspx> function is used
    to parse this string. cmd.exe has different rules for handling quoting,
    so extra work has to be done if it is involved. It isn't possible to
    consistantly create a single string that will be handled the same by
    cmd.exe and the stardard parsing rules.

    Perl will try to detect if you need the shell by detecting shell
    metacharacters. The routine that checks that uses different quoting
    rules from both cmd.exe and the native Win32 parsing. Extra work must
    therefore be done to protect against this autodetection.

SUBROUTINES
  quote_native
    Quotes as a string to pass directly to a program using native methods
    like Win32::Spawn(). This is the safest option to use if possible.

  quote_cmd
    Quotes as a string to be run through cmd.exe, such as in a batch file.

  quote_system_list
    Quotes as a list to be passed to system or exec. This is equally as safe
    as "quote_native", but you must ensure you have more than one item being
    quoted for the list to be usable with system.

  quote_system_string
    Like "quote_system_list", but returns a single string. Some argument
    lists cannot be properly quoted using this function.

  quote_system
    Switches between "quote_system_list" and "quote_system_string" based on
    the number of items quoted.

  quote_system_cmd
    Quotes as a single string that will always be run with cmd.exe.

  quote_literal
    Quotes a single parameter in native form.

  cmd_escape
    Escapes a string to be passed untouched by cmd.exe.

CAVEATS
    *   Newlines (\n or \r) and null (\0) can't be properly quoted when
        running through cmd.exe.

    *   This module re-implements some under-specified part of the perl
        internals to accurately perform its work.
