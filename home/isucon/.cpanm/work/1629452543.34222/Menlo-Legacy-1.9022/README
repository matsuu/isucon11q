NAME

    Menlo::Legacy - Legacy internal and client support for Menlo

DESCRIPTION

    Menlo::Legacy is a package to install Menlo::CLI::Compat which is a
    compatibility library that implements the classic version of cpanminus
    internals and behavios. This is so that existing users of cpanm and API
    clients such as Carton, Carmel and App::cpm) can rely on the stable
    features and specific behaviors of cpanm.

    This way Menlo can evolve and be refactored without the fear of
    breaking any downstream clients, including cpanm itself.
