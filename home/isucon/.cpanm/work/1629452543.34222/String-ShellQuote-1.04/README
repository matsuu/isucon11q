This distribution contains the String::ShellQuote module, plus a command-line
interface to it.  It contains some functions which are useful for quoting
strings which are going to pass through the shell or a shell-like object.  It
is useful for doing robust tool programming, particularly when dealing with
files whose names contain white space or shell globbing characters.

To build it, run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

For more detailed instructions see "man perlmodinstall", "perldoc
perlmodinstall", or http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html.

The documentation is embeded in the module, use

    perldoc ShellQuote.pm

to read it before installation.
