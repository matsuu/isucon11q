.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Many online services that are centered around \s-1CPAN\s0 attempt to
associate multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from
the filename of the upload. For most distributions this is easy as
they have used ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the
distribution, which results in a uniform name. But sadly not all
uploads are created in this way.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`CPAN::DistnameInfo\*(C'\fR uses heuristics that have been learnt by
<http://search.cpan.org/> to extract the distribution name and
version from filenames and also report if the version is to be
treated as a developer release
.PP
The constructor takes a single pathname, returning an object with the following methods
.IP "cpanid" 4
.IX Item "cpanid"
If the path given looked like a \s-1CPAN\s0 authors directory path, then this will be the
the \s-1CPAN\s0 id of the author.
.IP "dist" 4
.IX Item "dist"
The name of the distribution
.IP "distvname" 4
.IX Item "distvname"
The file name with any suffix and leading directory names removed
.IP "filename" 4
.IX Item "filename"
If the path given looked like a \s-1CPAN\s0 authors directory path, then this will be the
path to the file relative to the detected \s-1CPAN\s0 author directory. Otherwise it is the path
that was passed in.
.IP "maturity" 4
.IX Item "maturity"
The maturity of the distribution. This will be either \f(CW\*(C`released\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`developer\*(C'\fR
.IP "extension" 4
.IX Item "extension"
The extension of the distribution, often used to denote the archive type (e.g. 'tar.gz')
.IP "pathname" 4
.IX Item "pathname"
The pathname that was passed to the constructor when creating the object.
.IP "properties" 4
.IX Item "properties"
This will return a list of key-value pairs, suitable for assigning to a hash,
for the known properties.
.IP "version" 4
.IX Item "version"
The extracted version
