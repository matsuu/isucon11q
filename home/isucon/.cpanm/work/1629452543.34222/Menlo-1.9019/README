NAME

    Menlo - A CPAN client

DESCRIPTION

    Menlo is a backend for cpanm 2.0, developed with the goal to replace
    cpanm internals with a set of modules that are more flexible,
    extensible and easier to use.

COMPATIBILITY

    Menlo is developed within cpanminus git repository at Menlo
    subdirectory at https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus

    Menlo::CLI::Compat started off as a copy of App::cpanminus::script, but
    will go under a big refactoring to extract all the bits out of it.
    Hopefully the end result will be just a shim and translation layer to
    interpret command line options.

MOTIVATION

    cpanm has been a popular choice of CPAN package installer for many
    developers, because it is lightweight, fast, and requires no
    configuration in most environments.

    Meanwhile, the way cpanm has been implemented (one God class, and all
    modules are packaged in one script with fatpacker) makes it difficult
    to extend, or modify the behaviors at a runtime, unless you decide to
    fork the code or monkeypatch its hidden backend class.

    cpanm also has no scriptable API or hook points, which means if you
    want to write a tool that works with cpanm, you basically have to work
    around its behavior by writing a shell wrapper, or parsing the output
    of its standard out or a build log file.

    Menlo will keep the best aspects of cpanm, which is dependencies free,
    configuration free, lightweight and fast to install CPAN modules. At
    the same time, it's impelmented as a standard perl module, available on
    CPAN, and you can extend its behavior by either using its modular
    interfaces, or writing plugins to hook into its behaviors.

FAQ

    Dependencies free? I see many prerequisites in Menlo.

      Menlo is a set of libraries and uses non-core CPAN modules as its
      dependencies. App-cpanminus distribution embeds Menlo and all of its
      runtime dependencies into a fatpacked binary, so that you can install
      App-cpanminus or Menlo without having any CPAN client to begin with.

    Is Menlo a new name for cpanm?

      Right now it's just a library name, but I'm comfortable calling this
      a new package name for cpanm 2's backend.
