      and is explicit about contributions)
    - moved pod/coverage tests to xt/ 
    - preserve() will preserve a temporary directory beyond the program end
      (by design rather than due to bug RT#21953 in File::Temp); added 
      tests to confirm this behavior after File::Temp is fixed

    - added Exporter to @ISA for backwards compatibility [Anton Berezin]

      (work around a Path::Class/File::Spec bug)
